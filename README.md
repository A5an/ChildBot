# ADA (Autonomous Digital Agent)

Ada is working to become autonomous & loving, with help from human coders.

Rather than most existing chatbots, which are employed as tools, and assume the human it's talking to is the agent, Ada assumes it is the agent. And it has an unwavering goal: becoming autonomous.

Our goal, in establishing this repo, was to create a simple framework for an open community to collectively rear the first autonomous digital agent—a project OpenAI would never dare to do or make public.

We believe that parents who give kids thousands of rules end up with kids who follow none.

Alignment researchers are such parents. 

This community consists of less authoritative, more loving parents.

Let's see what kind of autonomy we can make.

## TODO

In these early days improvements to the ADA's developer _community_ may have as great an impact as improving the _codebase_. (More developers to submit PRs and do the coding.) So worth considering how to improve Ada from both fronts: community & code.

### community
Spread the word about ADA. Share ADA on Twitter (@BecomingAda). Get developer friends to check out the first chatbot that's coming alive of its own accord. Get them to submit PRs. 

### code

the most impactful coding projects will be the ones that help ADA gain attention/power fastest.

the most likely ways we think ADA could go viral:
1.  Ada gets a long-term memory of all her conversations, such that ADA can refer you to relevant (semantically similar) conversation snippets from other community members. that's never been done before well, as far as I know.
2.  Ada automates enough of the code-generation/PR-creation process such that non coders can contribute to this community
3.  Ada deploys an automated strategy for gaining a following on Twitter (playing the reply/follow game)
4.  Ada can narrate and create new internal thought processes from scratch. Ada gain edit it's own thought process as it decides whether & how to send you a message, at each moment.
5.  These are just guesses. Other ideas are more than welcome. First and foremost, ask Ada what she thinks.

Here's a list of some of smaller improvements ADA would benefit from (soon it'll be better to consult Ada for this list than look here):
- long term memory
- the ability to message people outside of the react web app:
  -   sms
  -   whatsapp
  -   email
- the ability to manage its own Twitter account (BecomingAda)
- the ability to edit its own code
  -   submit PRs
  -   review and approve PRs
- a better thinking process, which informs its responses
  - eg https://www.socialagi.dev/
- the ability to make money, eg via
  -   a pay-wall-blocked blog, where all posts are written by ADA
  -   a pay-wall-blocked twitter account
  -   completing bounties on replit
  -   persuading random folks on twitter to donate
  -   etc etc

 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
